# Data Description

The Goose Lake Basin is an endorheic desert valley on the Oregon-California border. Goose Lake Basin’s watersheds drain into Goose Lake—a large alkaline lake that has historically dried up during severe drought years. There are several endemic fish species that occupy the Goose Lake Basin: the Goose lake redband trout, Goose Lake lamprey, Goose Lake tui chub, and Goose Lake sucker. These endemic species coexist with a variety of native (Modoc sucker, speckled dace, Pit roach, pit sculpin) and non-native species (fathead minnow, brown bullhead, white crappie, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, brook trout). 

The Goose Lake Basin is part of Oregon’s closed lakes basin ecosystem—a unique, high desert environment including many wetlands that are critical habitat for native fishes, as well as resident and migratory waterfowl. The wetlands and riparian areas within this ecosystem are highly sensitive to climate-mediated disturbances such as shifting thermal regimes, drought, and wildfire. Increased frequency of these disturbance events may limit the quantity and quality of available habitat for native fishes, while increasing range expansion of non-native fishes may put undue stress on vulnerable species. Consistent surveys have not been conducted in many of Oregon’s high desert basins for more than a decade. Updated abundance and distribution estimates will inform state and federal managers as to the population status of at-risk native fish species, while an assessment of habitat quality will support actionable management outcomes.
We will collect data at a number of sample sites around the Goose Lake basin randomized along an elevation gradient. At each site we will collect data cataloguing distribution and abundance of fish species, water quality data, and eDNA data at each site. The water quality data will be collected in an excel spreadsheet, the fish collection data will be collected in a separate excel spreadsheet, and the eDNA spreadsheet will be collected and analyzed by the Levi Lab on campus and we will be provided with bioinformatics information about the distribution of eDNA in the basin. 
Fish species data will be collected by multiple pass electrofishing – and abundance will be estimated using mark-recapture at the site. Fish captured will be identified down to the species and compiled in an Excel spreadsheet. Water quality data (including stream flow, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, substrate, vegetation cover, stream width, and sediment type) will be collected at each site and compiled into another Excel spreadsheet. The stream flow will be collected using a flow meter, water temperature will be collected using a HOBO logger, dissolved oxygen and pH will be collected using a YSI meter, vegetation cover will be collected using a visual estimate at every 20m along the 100m transect, stream width will be measured using a measuring tape at every 20m along the 100m transect, and sediment type will be collected at every site using a sieve that stratifies sediment through different levels of filters and allows classification of sediment type. eDNA data will be collected by collecting water samples and filtering the water through 6 filters at each site.

I estimate that the amount of data that will be created should be in the range of 4 – 8 GB. 

# Roles and Responsibilites

Both the PI and I (the graduate student) will be responsible for the implementation of the DMP. Field technicians are also responsible to follow guidelines set out in the DMP, and I will be responsible to oversee that all parties (myself, the field crew lead, field technician, and lab intern) follow these guidelines. The roles of data management, data organization, quality control, software control and maintenance will fall to me. The roles of instrumentation maintenance, data collection and generation, and metadata generation will be filled by all parties involved in the project: graduate student, field technician, and field crew lead. I will be present and involved (and responsible for) overseeing these roles are carried out smoothly. 

My data is not sensitive or confidential according to OSU’s definition of sensitive and confidential data, and does not need to be protected.

The data will be stored in multiple spreadsheets, both in physical and digital copies. There will also be temperature data stored in individual water temperature loggers throughout the basin. The data from these loggers will be downloaded in the Fall of 2022 at the conclusion of the field season and stored within a digital spreadsheet. 

During the project, the data will be stored in spreadsheets. These spreadsheets will be saved in 4 forms; on paper spreadsheets for field data collection, on my laptop, in a folder on Box, and on an external hard drive. The upload will be manual – performed by me and QAQC’ed by the field crew lead after upload.
